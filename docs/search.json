    "text": "I am a third-year PhD student in Biostatistics at Columbia University, advised by Dr. Daniel Malinsky. Before this, I worked with Dr. Elizabeth Stuart and Dr. John Jackson at Johns Hopkins University, where I earned my MS in Biostatistics in 2021. I completed my BS in Psychology from National Taiwan University in 2018.\nMy research interests lie in causal inference. Broadly, I am interested in developing statistical methods for inferring causality with causal graphical models and observational (i.e., non-experimental) data.\n\nMy CV: link\nMy resume: link"
