I am a third-year PhD student in Biostatistics at Columbia University, advised by [Dr. Daniel Malinsky](http://www.dmalinsky.com/). Before this, I worked with [Dr. Elizabeth Stuart](https://www.elizabethstuart.org/) and [Dr. John Jackson](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/faculty/3410/john-w-jackson) at Johns Hopkins University, where I earned my MS in Biostatistics in 2021. I completed my BS in Psychology from National Taiwan University in 2018.

My research focuses on causal inference methodology. Broadly, I am interested in developing statistical methods for inferring causality with causal graphical models and observational data with complex confounding structures. I am also interested in applied research within the social and behavioral sciences.

My CV and resume are available here:\
[CV](media/cv_oct2024.pdf), [Resume](media/resume_oct2024.pdf)\

I currently live in Brooklyn, NY with my dog, Palermo.
